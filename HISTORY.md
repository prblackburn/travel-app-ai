# Development History

## Session 1: Project Initialization & Planning (Nov 6, 2025)

### Overview
Completed comprehensive project setup phase, transforming workshop template into fully-specified travel planning application with complete documentation and systematic task breakdown.

### Completed Tasks
**Pre-Development Setup:**
- ✅ Project conception and specification development
- ✅ Complete functional requirements with user stories
- ✅ Technical architecture design with database schema
- ✅ Development standards and coding conventions
- ✅ Systematic 30-task roadmap with dependencies
- ✅ Remix TypeScript project initialization
- ✅ Development tooling configuration

### Key Implementation Details

**Documentation Created:**
- `FUNCTIONAL.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, business rules for 3 core features
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Complete tech stack, database schema, API design, component patterns
- `CLAUDE.md`: TypeScript/Remix standards, naming conventions, development workflow
- `TO-DO.md`: 30 sequential tasks across 9 phases with explicit dependencies

**Project Structure Established:**
- Feature-based architecture (`/src/features` with trips, itinerary, packing modules)
- Shared infrastructure (`/src/shared` for components, hooks, utilities, types)
- Database layer (`/src/db` with Drizzle ORM schema and migrations)
- Remix app structure (`/src/app` with routes and root configuration)

**Technology Stack Confirmed:**
- TypeScript (strict mode) + Remix full-stack framework
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- pnpm package manager
- CSS Modules for styling
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

### Important Decisions & Patterns

**Architecture Patterns:**
1. **Feature-based organization**: Group related code by business domain rather than technical layer
2. **Custom hooks pattern**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks for state management
3. **Functional utilities**: Pure functions for data transformation and validation
4. **Type-first development**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation
5. **Explicit return types**: All exported functions must have return type annotations

**Database Design:**
- SQLite for simplicity with WAL mode for concurrency
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at) on all entities
- Text IDs using UUIDs for better scalability

**Development Workflow:**
- Conventional Commits format for clear change history
- Feature branches with main branch for stable code
- Comprehensive testing strategy focusing on business logic
- Strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration

### Current State

**Environment Status:**
- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- Project structure created but not yet implemented
- Dependencies configured in package.json
- Development tooling configured (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest)

**Next Phase Readiness:**
- Ready to begin Task 1: Initialize Project Structure
- All planning documentation complete and committed
- Clear task dependencies established for systematic development

**Key Variables/Configurations:**
- Database: SQLite file-based with Drizzle ORM
- Package manager: pnpm (configured in project)
- Node.js: Latest LTS requirement
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library setup

### Standards Established
All coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns documented in `CLAUDE.md`. No additional standards learned during this session as implementation has not yet begun.

### No Deviations
Project specifications remain as originally defined. No changes required to functional or architectural documentation at this stage.
