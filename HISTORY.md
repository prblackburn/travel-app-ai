# Development History

## Session 1: Project Initialization & Planning (Nov 6, 2025)

### Overview

Completed comprehensive project setup phase, transforming workshop template into fully-specified travel planning application with complete documentation and systematic task breakdown.

### Completed Tasks

**Pre-Development Setup:**

- ✅ Project conception and specification development
- ✅ Complete functional requirements with user stories
- ✅ Technical architecture design with database schema
- ✅ Development standards and coding conventions
- ✅ Systematic 27-task roadmap with dependencies (testing removed)
- ✅ Remix TypeScript project initialization
- ✅ Development tooling configuration

**Session 2: Task 1 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 1: Initialize Project Structure** - Complete
  - Drizzle ORM and SQLite dependencies installed
  - Package.json scripts added (db:migrate, db:seed)
  - Testing infrastructure completely removed from all specs
  - Project ready for development tools configuration

**Session 3: Task 2 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 2: Configure Development Tools** - Complete
  - ESLint configured with strict TypeScript rules enforcing CLAUDE.md standards
  - Prettier integration with consistent formatting (single quotes, 100 char width)
  - Package scripts added: lint, lint:fix, format, format:check
  - All existing code fixed to comply with strict standards
  - Only 2 acceptable console.log warnings remain in Remix error handling

**Session 4: CSS Modules Migration (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Tailwind CSS to CSS Modules Conversion** - Complete
  - Converted 20+ Tailwind utility classes to semantic CSS Module styles
  - Created `src/app/styles/index.module.css` with proper dark mode support
  - Updated React component to use semantic class names (.container, .content, .header, etc.)
  - Maintained exact visual appearance while following CLAUDE.md CSS Modules standard
  - Build successful with CSS properly bundled and minified (1.74 kB)

### Key Implementation Details

**Documentation Created:**

- `FUNCTIONAL.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, business rules for 3 core features
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Complete tech stack, database schema, API design, component patterns
- `CLAUDE.md`: TypeScript/Remix standards, naming conventions, development workflow
- `TO-DO.md`: 30 sequential tasks across 9 phases with explicit dependencies

**Project Structure Established:**

- Feature-based architecture (`/src/features` with trips, itinerary, packing modules)
- Shared infrastructure (`/src/shared` for components, hooks, utilities, types)
- Database layer (`/src/db` with Drizzle ORM schema and migrations)
- Remix app structure (`/src/app` with routes and root configuration)

**Technology Stack Confirmed:**

- TypeScript (strict mode) + Remix full-stack framework
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- pnpm package manager
- CSS Modules for styling
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality (strict configuration active)

### Important Decisions & Patterns

**Architecture Patterns:**

1. **Feature-based organization**: Group related code by business domain rather than technical layer
2. **Custom hooks pattern**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks for state management
3. **Functional utilities**: Pure functions for data transformation and validation
4. **Type-first development**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation
5. **Explicit return types**: All exported functions must have return type annotations

**Database Design:**

- SQLite for simplicity with WAL mode for concurrency
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at) on all entities
- Text IDs using UUIDs for better scalability

**Development Workflow:**

- Conventional Commits format for clear change history
- Feature branches with main branch for stable code
- Strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration (no testing)

**Session 5: Task 3 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 3: Database Setup with Drizzle ORM** - Complete
  - Created complete Drizzle schema in `/src/db/schema.ts` with 4 tables (trips, activities, packing_lists, packing_items)
  - Configured database connection in `/src/db/index.ts` with WAL mode for concurrency
  - Set up Drizzle Kit configuration in `drizzle.config.ts`
  - Generated and applied initial migration using sqlite3 CLI (workaround for better-sqlite3 bindings issue)
  - Created comprehensive seed script with realistic sample data
  - All tables created with proper foreign key relationships and CASCADE deletes

**Session 6: Task 4 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 4: Define TypeScript Types and Interfaces** - Complete
  - Created comprehensive `src/shared/types/index.ts` with 4 core entity interfaces
  - Types exactly match database schema field names and data types
  - Added form data types, API response types, and utility types
  - Included hook return types and component props for future tasks
  - Packing categories aligned with actual seed data ('Beach', 'Documents', 'Clothing')
  - All types pass TypeScript strict mode validation

### Current State

**Environment Status:**

- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- Complete Remix TypeScript project structure in place
- Dependencies configured: Drizzle ORM, SQLite, better-sqlite3, tsx
- Development tooling configured (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier)
- Database: SQLite with 4 tables, WAL mode enabled
- Type system: Complete type definitions for all entities
- Testing completely removed from project scope

**Next Phase Readiness:**

- Tasks 1-4 completed successfully
- Ready to begin Task 5: Implement Database Schema
- Type definitions complete and validated against existing schema
- CSS Modules fully implemented, development tools enforcing strict standards

**Key Variables/Configurations:**

- Database: SQLite file-based with Drizzle ORM
- Package manager: pnpm (configured in project)
- Node.js: Latest LTS requirement
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled with explicit return types required
- ESLint: Strict rules active with Prettier integration
- CSS: CSS Modules implemented, Tailwind removed
- Testing: **REMOVED** - No testing framework or infrastructure

### Standards Established

All coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns documented in `CLAUDE.md`. ESLint configuration enforces these standards automatically. Testing-related standards removed completely.

### Implementation Details

**Task 2 - Development Tools Configuration:**

- ESLint rules: Explicit return types, no `any`, nullish coalescing, import ordering, naming conventions
- Prettier config: 100 char width, single quotes, trailing commas, LF line endings
- Component naming: PascalCase allowed for React components, camelCase for functions
- Import structure: External → Internal → Types with alphabetical ordering
- All existing Remix template code updated to comply with strict standards

**CSS Modules Migration:**

- Converted Tailwind classes to semantic CSS: `.container`, `.content`, `.header`, `.navigation`
- Dark mode support via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` queries
- CSS file structure: `src/app/styles/` directory for component-specific styles
- Build optimization: CSS bundled as separate .css files (1.74 kB minified)
- Maintained visual fidelity while achieving semantic, maintainable styling

### Deviations from Original Specs

**Major Change:** Removed all testing infrastructure per user request

- Eliminated Vitest + React Testing Library from tech stack
- Removed Tasks 25-27 (all testing tasks) from TO-DO.md
- Updated review process to exclude test requirements
- Renumbered final tasks from 30 to 27 total tasks
