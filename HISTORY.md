# Development History

## Session 1: Project Initialization & Planning (Nov 6, 2025)

### Overview
Completed comprehensive project setup phase, transforming workshop template into fully-specified travel planning application with complete documentation and systematic task breakdown.

### Completed Tasks
**Pre-Development Setup:**
- ✅ Project conception and specification development
- ✅ Complete functional requirements with user stories
- ✅ Technical architecture design with database schema
- ✅ Development standards and coding conventions
- ✅ Systematic 27-task roadmap with dependencies (testing removed)
- ✅ Remix TypeScript project initialization
- ✅ Development tooling configuration

**Session 2: Task 1 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**
- ✅ **Task 1: Initialize Project Structure** - Complete
  - Drizzle ORM and SQLite dependencies installed
  - Package.json scripts added (db:migrate, db:seed)
  - Testing infrastructure completely removed from all specs
  - Project ready for development tools configuration

### Key Implementation Details

**Documentation Created:**
- `FUNCTIONAL.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, business rules for 3 core features
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Complete tech stack, database schema, API design, component patterns
- `CLAUDE.md`: TypeScript/Remix standards, naming conventions, development workflow
- `TO-DO.md`: 30 sequential tasks across 9 phases with explicit dependencies

**Project Structure Established:**
- Feature-based architecture (`/src/features` with trips, itinerary, packing modules)
- Shared infrastructure (`/src/shared` for components, hooks, utilities, types)
- Database layer (`/src/db` with Drizzle ORM schema and migrations)
- Remix app structure (`/src/app` with routes and root configuration)

**Technology Stack Confirmed:**
- TypeScript (strict mode) + Remix full-stack framework
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- pnpm package manager
- CSS Modules for styling
- Vitest + React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality

### Important Decisions & Patterns

**Architecture Patterns:**
1. **Feature-based organization**: Group related code by business domain rather than technical layer
2. **Custom hooks pattern**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks for state management
3. **Functional utilities**: Pure functions for data transformation and validation
4. **Type-first development**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation
5. **Explicit return types**: All exported functions must have return type annotations

**Database Design:**
- SQLite for simplicity with WAL mode for concurrency
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at) on all entities
- Text IDs using UUIDs for better scalability

**Development Workflow:**
- Conventional Commits format for clear change history
- Feature branches with main branch for stable code
- Strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration (no testing)

### Current State

**Environment Status:**
- Git repository initialized with initial commit
- Basic Remix TypeScript project structure in place
- Dependencies configured with Drizzle ORM and SQLite
- Development tooling configured (ESLint, TypeScript)
- Testing completely removed from project scope

**Next Phase Readiness:**
- Task 1 completed successfully
- Ready to begin Task 2: Configure Development Tools
- All planning documentation updated to reflect no-testing approach

**Key Variables/Configurations:**
- Database: SQLite file-based with Drizzle ORM
- Package manager: pnpm (configured in project)
- Node.js: Latest LTS requirement
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- Testing: **REMOVED** - No testing framework or infrastructure

### Standards Established
All coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Testing-related standards removed completely.

### Deviations from Original Specs
**Major Change:** Removed all testing infrastructure per user request
- Eliminated Vitest + React Testing Library from tech stack
- Removed Tasks 25-27 (all testing tasks) from TO-DO.md
- Updated review process to exclude test requirements
- Renumbered final tasks from 30 to 27 total tasks
