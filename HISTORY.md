  - Maintained exact visual appearance while following CLAUDE.md CSS Modules standard
  - Build successful with CSS properly bundled and minified (1.74 kB)

### Key Implementation Details

**Documentation Created:**

- `FUNCTIONAL.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, business rules for 3 core features
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Complete tech stack, database schema, API design, component patterns
- `CLAUDE.md`: TypeScript/Remix standards, naming conventions, development workflow
- `TO-DO.md`: 30 sequential tasks across 9 phases with explicit dependencies

**Project Structure Established:**

- Feature-based architecture (`/src/features` with trips, itinerary, packing modules)
- Shared infrastructure (`/src/shared` for components, hooks, utilities, types)
- Database layer (`/src/db` with Drizzle ORM schema and migrations)
- Remix app structure (`/src/app` with routes and root configuration)

**Technology Stack Confirmed:**

- TypeScript (strict mode) + Remix full-stack framework
- SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
- pnpm package manager
- CSS Modules for styling
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality (strict configuration active)

### Important Decisions & Patterns

**Architecture Patterns:**

1. **Feature-based organization**: Group related code by business domain rather than technical layer
2. **Custom hooks pattern**: Extract business logic into reusable hooks for state management
3. **Functional utilities**: Pure functions for data transformation and validation
4. **Type-first development**: Define TypeScript interfaces before implementation
5. **Explicit return types**: All exported functions must have return type annotations

**Database Design:**

- SQLite for simplicity with WAL mode for concurrency
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at) on all entities
- Text IDs using UUIDs for better scalability

**Development Workflow:**

- Conventional Commits format for clear change history
- Feature branches with main branch for stable code
- Strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration (no testing)

**Session 5: Task 3 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 3: Database Setup with Drizzle ORM** - Complete
  - Created complete Drizzle schema in `/src/db/schema.ts` with 4 tables (trips, activities, packing_lists, packing_items)
  - Configured database connection in `/src/db/index.ts` with WAL mode for concurrency
  - Set up Drizzle Kit configuration in `drizzle.config.ts`
  - Generated and applied initial migration using sqlite3 CLI (workaround for better-sqlite3 bindings issue)
  - Created comprehensive seed script with realistic sample data
  - All tables created with proper foreign key relationships and CASCADE deletes

**Session 6: Task 4 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 4: Define TypeScript Types and Interfaces** - Complete
  - Created comprehensive `src/shared/types/index.ts` with 4 core entity interfaces
  - Types exactly match database schema field names and data types
  - Added form data types, API response types, and utility types
  - Included hook return types and component props for future tasks
  - Packing categories aligned with actual seed data ('Beach', 'Documents', 'Clothing')
  - All types pass TypeScript strict mode validation

**Session 7: Task 5 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 5: Implement Database Schema** - Complete
  - Enhanced existing Drizzle schema with 8 strategic performance indexes
  - All 4 tables (trips, activities, packing_lists, packing_items) properly indexed
  - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE deletes validated
  - Schema-TypeScript alignment confirmed (100% match)
  - Migration applied using sqlite3 CLI workaround for better-sqlite3 bindings issue
  - Database structure ready for seed data and service layer implementation

**Session 8: Task 6 Completion + Critical Database Fix (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 6: Create Database Seed Data** - Complete
  - Created comprehensive seed script with 3 realistic trips (Paris, Hawaii, Tokyo)
  - Added 12 activities across different travel scenarios (leisure, business, family)
  - Generated 5 packing lists with 22 items covering 6 categories (Clothing, Documents, Electronics, Beach, Health, Food)
  - Implemented sqlite3 CLI workaround for better-sqlite3 bindings issue in seed workflow
  - Package script `pnpm db:seed` now handles migration + seed data application
  - All sample data demonstrates functional requirements and business rules compliance

- 🔧 **Critical Infrastructure Fix: Database Driver Switch**
  - **Issue Found**: better-sqlite3 bindings fail in Remix dev server environment
  - **Validation Method**: Created `/debug` route to test full stack integration
  - **Solution**: Switched from `better-sqlite3` to `@libsql/client` for Remix compatibility
  - **Result**: Full stack validation successful - database, types, and Remix integration working
  - **Impact**: Foundation now proven solid, can build features with confidence

**Session 9: Task 7 Completion (Nov 6, 2025)**

- ✅ **Task 7: Build Shared Utility Functions** - Complete
  - **Date Utilities** (`dateUtils.ts`): Formatting, validation, comparison for YYYY-MM-DD/HH:MM formats
  - **Error Handling** (`errorUtils.ts`): Comprehensive error codes, AppError creation, SQLite-specific patterns
  - **General Formatters** (`formatters.ts`): Trip/activity/packing display formatting, text utilities
  - **Validation Utilities** (`validationUtils.ts`): Complete form validation, business rules, error formatting
  - All utilities follow functional programming patterns with explicit return types
  - Supports nullish coalescing (??) operator for safer defaults
  - Foundation ready for service layer and UI components in upcoming tasks

**Session 10: Scope Reduction - Packing Feature Removal (Nov 6, 2025)**

- 🎯 **Strategic Scope Reduction** - Removed packing lists feature entirely to focus on core functionality

**Session 14: Remix Routing Fixes & Consistency (Nov 6, 2025)**

- 🔧 **Critical Routing Issues Fixed** - Deep nested routes causing edit/new activity failures
- 🎯 **Root Cause**: Remix routing limitations with 4+ level nesting (`trips.$tripId.activities.$activityId_.edit.tsx`)
- ✅ **Solution**: Implemented consistent flat routing structure for all activity operations
- 🛣️ **New Route Structure**: All activity routes use flat pattern (`activity.$activityId.edit.tsx`, `activity.new.tsx`, etc.)
- 📐 **Consistency**: Eliminated mixed nested/flat routing patterns across the application
- 🚀 **Result**: All activity CRUD operations now working reliably (create, read, update, delete)

**Session 15: Form Styling Consistency Fix (Nov 6, 2025)**

- 🎨 **Form Styling Alignment** - Updated trip edit forms to match activity edit styles
- 🎯 **Issue**: Trip forms had white background causing poor label contrast/readability
- ✅ **Solution**: Updated TripForm.module.css to match ActivityForm.module.css clean styling
- 🧹 **Changes Applied**: Removed white background, standardized spacing (1rem), consistent mobile breakpoints (640px)
- 📐 **Result**: Both edit forms now have consistent clean appearance with better readability

### Deviations from Original Specs

1. **Testing removed** - Eliminated all testing infrastructure per user request
2. **Database driver switch** - Changed to @libsql/client for Remix compatibility  
3. **Packing feature removed** - Simplified scope to trips + itinerary only (reduced 27→23 tasks)
