# Travel Planning App - Functional Specification

## Overview

A web-based travel planning application that enables users to create trips and plan detailed itineraries. Built with TypeScript, Remix, and SQLite for rapid development and deployment.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Management

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to create a new trip with basic details so I can start planning
- As a user, I want to view all my trips in one place so I can manage them easily
- As a user, I want to edit trip details so I can update information as plans change
- As a user, I want to delete trips I no longer need so I can keep my list organized

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can create trips with: name, destination, start date, end date, description
- Users can view a list of all their trips with key details visible
- Users can edit any trip detail after creation
- Users can delete trips with confirmation prompt
- Trip dates must be validated (end date after start date)
- Destination field supports free text input

### 2. Itinerary Planner

**User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to add activities to my trip so I can plan my schedule
- As a user, I want to organize activities by date and time so I can see my daily schedule
- As a user, I want to edit activity details so I can adjust my plans
- As a user, I want to remove activities I no longer want so I can keep my itinerary current

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can add activities with: name, date, time, location, notes
- Activities are displayed chronologically within each trip
- Users can edit all activity details
- Users can delete activities with confirmation
- Activity dates must fall within trip date range
- Time conflicts are highlighted but not blocked (user choice)


## User Interface Requirements

### Navigation

- Persistent sidebar with main navigation (Trips, Current Trip context)
- Breadcrumb navigation showing current location
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Key Pages

1. **Trip Dashboard** - Overview of all trips
2. **Trip Detail** - Individual trip with itinerary management
3. **Itinerary View** - Chronological list of activities

### User Experience Principles

- Progressive disclosure - show details when needed
- Quick actions - common tasks accessible with minimal clicks
- Visual feedback - clear indication of actions and states
- Consistent patterns - similar interactions work the same way

## Data Requirements

### Trip Entity

- ID, name, destination, start date, end date, description, created date, updated date

### Activity Entity

- ID, trip ID, name, date, time, location, notes, created date, updated date

## Business Rules

1. **Trip Validation**

   - End date must be after start date
   - Trip name is required and must be unique per user
   - Destination is required

2. **Activity Validation**

   - Activity date must fall within trip dates
   - Time format validation (24-hour or 12-hour)
   - Activity name is required

## Success Metrics

- Users can complete core workflow (create trip â†’ add activities) in under 3 minutes
- Zero data loss during normal operations
- All user inputs validated with helpful error messages
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

## Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

- Packing lists and item management
- Multi-user collaboration
- Weather integration
- Budget tracking
